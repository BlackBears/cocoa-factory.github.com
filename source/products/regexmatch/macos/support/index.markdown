### RegexMatch support ###

#### FGA's (Frequently Given Answers) #### 

> What programming languages are currently supported?

You can export code in Objective-C, Perl, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby.  It seemed like these were the right ones to start with; but if you really want others, drop us a line.

> How do I export code?

We imagine you want to actually use your code somewhere.  So RegexMatch can export code to the pasteboard - so that you can paste it into another app such as a text editor.  To export code, click on the {} brackets in the regex box.

> How do I get in touch with you about an issue?

Two ways: `support@cocoafactory.com` and `@CocoaFactory`
