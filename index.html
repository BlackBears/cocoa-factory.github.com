  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are as many schemes for versioning of Xcode projects as there are developers.  One of the difficulties, of course, is the way that Xcode labels the two version identifiers in the IDE.  First, there&#8217;s <code>CFBundleShortVersionString</code> which according the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html">documentation</a> is:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;the <strong>release version number</strong> of the bundle which identifies a released iteration of the app.  The release version number is a string comprised of three period-separated integers.  The first integer represents major revisions to the app, such as revisions that implement new features or major changes. The second integer denotes revisions that implement less prominent features. The third integer represents maintenance releases.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This differs from <code>CFBundleVersion</code> which is:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;the <strong>build version number</strong> of the bundle, which identifies an iteration (released or unreleased) of the bundle. The build version number should be a string comprised of three non-negative, period-separated integers with the first integer being greater than zero.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Importantly, Apple uses <code>CFBundleVersion</code> to version your app and <code>CFBundleShortVersionString</code> to present the version to the user.  So, on submission, the <code>CFBundleVersion</code> must be higher than the last version submitted.  That&#8217;s why I use the following script to auto-increment the <code>CFBundleVersion</code> every time I build the source:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">buildNumber</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c <span class="s2">&quot;Print CFBundleVersion&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$INFOPLIST_FILE&quot;</span><span class="k">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">buildNumber</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$((</span><span class="nv">$buildNumber</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="k">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c <span class="s2">&quot;Set :CFBundleVersion $buildNumber&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$INFOPLIST_FILE&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like every other developer, I lookup information, API&#8217;s, blog posts every day.  Recently, I was inspired to change that way that I accumulate all of this data.  Since I&#8217;m a long-term <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com">DEVONthink</a> user. I decided to harness some of is power to organize my reference materials.  Here&#8217;s how I went about organizing everything and why.</p>

<h3>Make a committment to keeping everything in one place</h3>

<p>As I started this process, I was trying to solve two problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>I wanted to be able to find developer-related information that was important to me.</li>
<li>I wanted to control the data - meaning I wanted to have the data stored locally.</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to find information again without having to reconstruct the Google search that found it in the first place.  Sometimes, you find interesting material only after a circuitous search.  It&#8217;s hard to remember those pathways and they are dynamic.  Further, I&#8217;m in the process of designing and building an office out in the country where web access is harder.</li>
</ul>


<p>These goals are best met by ensuring there&#8217;s a place for everything go.  In my case, I keep a single DEVONThink database called <code>dev</code> for this.  I have others where I keep personal data, hobby-related information, etc.</p>

<h3>Gather everything</h3>

<p>I started by adopting the GTD approach of gathering everything in one place.  In this case, it meant grabbing references from Dropbox, from Evernote, and a bunch of other places and dropping them in a virgin DEVONthink database.  I&#8217;ve used DEVONthink for years - long before Evernote and the majority of my reference materials were already there; so the workflow was already somewhat familiar to me.  After ongoing mental debates about the merits of DEVONthink (DT) vs Evernote, I&#8217;ve finally come down on the side of DT.  Although I like the accessibility of Evernote, with DT, the security of the data, its format, and location are all known to me.  It&#8217;s certainly not as ubiquitous as Evernote; but DT syncing is getting better.  Nonetheless, I&#8217;m sure everything about this workflow is doable in Evernote, too.</p>

<p>Whatever tool you use, gather everything means exactly that - find a software home that can keep everything you need and put it there.  And classify it.</p>

<p>In what form do I save my data?  It depends.  Basically, I favor plain text > right text > pdf.  I save a lot of web pages for offline reference.  It&#8217;s easy to use the Safari DT plugin to generate paginated PDF content.  That said, sometimes I&#8217;ll capture rich text from the Reader version of the page and save that.</p>

<h3>Setup a basic group structure</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/DT_C_expanded.png' width='' height='' alt='Figure 1 DEVONthink groups' title='Figure 1 DEVONthink groups'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 1 DEVONthink groups</span></span>  The top-level entity in DT is the database, followed by <strong>Groups</strong>.  I created a single group called &#8220;references&#8221; and sub-groups by letters &#8220;A&#8221; to &#8220;Z&#8221;.  Each letter gets alphabetic topics. Figure 1 shows my current &#8220;C&#8221; group expanded to show subgroups.  As an example, note that although the &#8220;core data&#8221; group has only three items in it.  There are other locations where there may be other entries about Core Data, e.g. <code>NSManagedObjectContext</code> may have its own group.  We&#8217;ll get to tagging and search next.  The group structure is arbitrary because as you get better at tagging, the latter becomes the main way of finding things.  While I have a file-system bias, groups are becoming less-used because of the power of tag-based search.</p>

<h3>Setup and maintain a hierarchical tagging structure</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/DT_taglist.png' width='' height='' alt='Figure 2 Top-level tags' title='Figure 2 Top-level tags'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 2 Top-level tags</span></span>  Tags are an orthogonal way of finding information in DT.  Although you go drill-down the group hierarchy if you wanted (in a manner analogous to the file system), tags look orthogonally across the data.  And the better and more consistent you are with tagging, the better your searches become.  An important feature of DT tags is that they are <strong>hierarchical</strong> as I discovered <a href="http://www.organizingcreativity.com/2012/02/tagging-in-devonthink/">here</a>.  I spent a long while coming up with a concise hierarchy for my data which is shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p>Since the tag hierarchy is what&#8217;s important to this system, I&#8217;ll briefly explain what each top-level item is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>language</strong>  Since many of my entities contain code, I wanted to be able to find items by language.</li>
<li><strong>main_areas</strong>  This holds all of the - well, main areas.</li>
<li><strong>people</strong>    I tag posts that are attributable to a particular author here.  The format of the tag is like <code>people_fnln</code> or <code>people_alanduncan</code>.</li>
<li><strong>platforms</strong> e.g. <code>platform_apple_ios</code></li>
<li><strong>source</strong>  Where did the entity come from?</li>
<li><strong>status</strong>  Is the item read or not?</li>
<li><strong>use_tye</strong> Why was the item saved?  e.g. <code>use_type_reference</code> or <code>use_type_tutorial</code></li>
</ul>


<p>The beauty of hierarchical tags is that by clicking on any level of the hierarchy you can see everything in that branch.  Surprisingly useful.</p>

<h3>Use tags to advantage</h3>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/DT_workflow_expanded.png' width='' height='' alt='Figure 3 Tag hierarchies' title='Figure 3 Tag hierarchies'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 3 Tag hierarchies</span></span>  Since tags are key to finding content in my databases, I treat them with a lot of care, adding layers of specificity where it makes sense and pruning others.  Figure 3 shows one of my <code>main_areas</code> - <code>topic_workflow</code> fully expanded to show the hierarchy.  One of the neat things that you can do with DT tags is dragging documents between tags.  By doing this, you can add a new tag to a document.  If you delete a document from a tag&#8217;s list, you remove that tag from the document.</p>

<h3>Frequently Given Answers</h3>

<h4>What about mobile access?</h4>

<p>DEVONthink has an iOS version.  I couldn&#8217;t really make use of it.  Instead, the desktop version of DT Pro Office runs an embedded web server.  I expose that on the WAN.  Works for me.</p>

<h4>What else do you find useful?</h4>

<p>DT allows you to hyperlink content.  This is useful to me in the following way:  let&#8217;s assume that I&#8217;ve been working on figuring out how to do something.  I&#8217;ve got a handful of tabs open in Safari with pages that helped me accomplish the task.  When I&#8217;ve finished, I&#8217;d like to write up a summary so that if I have to do it again, I can refer to it.  In DT, I&#8217;d just import all of the pages as PDFs and hyperlink them into a rich-text document.  In a way, it&#8217;s like developing your own very highly tailored version of the web.</p>

<h4>Why don&#8217;t you use just use Evernote?</h4>

<p>I like Evernote. A lot.  But I really admire DEVONthink&#8217;s scriptability, the way its hyperlinking works and the fact that the data is on my machine.  In the end, it works for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t heard yet, the fifth iteration of <a href="http://nsconference.com">NSConference</a> was awesome.  Lots of great talks, meeting other developers, and of course, sunny Leicester, UK.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper left'><img class='caption' src='/images/icon_128x128.png' width='' height='' alt='Fig 1. Stamped icon' title='Fig 1. Stamped icon'><span class='caption-text'>Fig 1. Stamped icon</span></span> Among the great talks was Evan Doll&#8217;s about how Flipboard makes use of the development toolchain in novel ways to make their process more efficient and less error-prone.  Krzysztof Zablocki <a href="http://www.merowing.info/2013/03/overlaying-application-version-on-top-of-your-icon/">has written up</a> a great description on his implementation of Evan&#8217;s idea.  It works really well for iOS.  It&#8217;s such a neat trick, that I thought I&#8217;d build on it for Mac OS.  Turns out that core process is almost the same as Krzysztof&#8217;s; but with some twists.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of a new open source control called <code>CCFScrollingTabBar</code>, a refined scrolling control for iPhone.  You can find it on github <a href="https://github.com/cocoa-factory/CCFScrollingTabBar">here</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a little like <a href="https://github.com/jasarien/JSScrollableTabBar"><code>JSScrollableTabBar</code></a> with completely customizable colors.  Rather than just talk about it, here&#8217;s what it looks like:
<img class="right" src="/images/tab-bar-img-001.jpg">  For the developer, this is a simple component to use.  Just provide the instance of <code>CCFScrollableTabView</code> with the colors for the gradient background and text, and the titles of the tabs, and we take care of the rest.  You can receive delegate messages when the use taps on an item.  We setup a simple example project to see it in action.</p>

<h4>Using CCFScrollingTabBar in a nutshell</h4>

<p>Our example project uses a scrolling tab bar instantiated in a nib.  It should be exactly 41 pixels high.  Your instance of <code>CCFScrollingTabView</code> should have a delegate and a data source.  Without a data source you would see nothing.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it!  If you want to know when the user taps on an item, you should implement the <code>scrollableTabView:didSelectItemAtIndex:</code> method on the <code>CCFScrollableTabViewDelegate</code> protocol.  That way your class will get a message with the index of the selection.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://cocoapods.org/?q=rvm%20sy#">CocoaPods</a> is a popular new way to manage dependencies in Xcode projects.</p>

<h4>Canonical installation</h4>

<p>CocoaPods is installed as a ruby gem; and usually everything &#8216;just works.&#8217;  Here&#8217;s how you install CocoaPods:</p>

<h4>Failed installation</h4>

<p>However, CocoaPods installation can fail for a number of reasons.  Here are a few things to check if the installation fails:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Have you installed the Xcode command line tools?</strong>  If you update Xcode, then you need to re-download the command line tools.  This is a common gotcha.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are you using MacRuby?</strong> MacRuby is not supported.  Your ruby should be Ruby MRI 1.8.7 or 1.9.3</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Errors during installation</h4>

<p>Our initial attempt with <code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code> gave the following error:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>First, we tried to just install the libyaml package with <code>rvm pkg install libyaml</code> but this got us nowhere.  Same error when we try to <code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>.</p>

<p>Since we weren&#8217;t using ruby for anything else on the system, blowing away RVM seemed like a benign (if nuclear) option.  So we used <code>rvm implode</code> and removed all references to <code>.rvm</code> in our PATH.  You need to also take a look at <code>.bashrc</code> <code>.profile</code> and <code>.bash_profile</code> for other references to rvm if you want to try this option.  See the accepted answer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3558656/how-to-remove-rvm-ruby-version-manager-from-my-system">this question</a> for details on the nuclear option for removing <code>rvm</code>.</p>

<p>Next we reinstalled <code>rvm</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This installs <code>rvm</code> and the latest stable version of ruby.  Next update the terminal and check the version of ruby in use:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Darwin:~ alan<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm
</span><span class='line'>Darwin:~ alan<span class="nv">$ </span>which ruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Hmmm&#8230;.we&#8217;re still using the system ruby.  Let&#8217;s see what ruby versions we have:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Darwin:~ alan<span class="nv">$ </span>rvm list
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>A RVM version 1.18.5 <span class="o">(</span>stable<span class="o">)</span> is installed yet 1.15.7 <span class="o">(</span>stable<span class="o">)</span> is loaded.
</span><span class='line'>Please <span class="k">do </span>one of the following:
</span><span class='line'>  * <span class="s1">&#39;rvm reload&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  * open a new shell
</span><span class='line'>  * <span class="s1">&#39;echo rvm_auto_reload_flag=1 &gt;&gt; ~/.rvmrc&#39;</span> <span class="c"># for auto reload with msg.</span>
</span><span class='line'>  * <span class="s1">&#39;echo rvm_auto_reload_flag=2 &gt;&gt; ~/.rvmrc&#39;</span> <span class="c"># for silent auto reload.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, let&#8217;s do as it says and reload:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Darwin:~ alan<span class="nv">$ </span>rvm reload
</span><span class='line'>RVM reloaded!
</span><span class='line'>Darwin:~ alan<span class="nv">$ </span>rvm list
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>rvm rubies
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>   ruby-1.9.3-p194 <span class="o">[</span> x86_64 <span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">=</span>* ruby-1.9.3-p374 <span class="o">[</span> x86_64 <span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># =&gt; - current</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># =* - current &amp;&amp; default</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#  * - default</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can confirm the ruby version in use:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Darwin:~ alan<span class="nv">$ </span>which ruby
</span><span class='line'>/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p374/bin/ruby
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we should be good to go.  Let&#8217;s try installing CocoaPods again:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>Darwin:~ alan<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo gem install cocoapods

</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># many more lines follow...</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Success! Now back to the canonical installation:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>&#8220;`</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>For developers with more experience dealing with ruby, its versions and dependencies, deleting rvm and reinstalling may seem like a blunt instrument.  For me, this worked well and allowed us to start working with CocoaPods after a lot of earlier frustration.</p>

<p>If you try to expand items in <code>awakeFromNib</code>, it will fail because the content is not prepared until after <code>awakeFromNib</code> is called on the controller.  The key is to observe <code>content</code> on the <code>NSTreeController</code> using KVO.</p>

<p>This time, we&#8217;ll take a break from the analytical mode to try our hand at writing a simple program in assembly.   We&#8217;re going to use two different assemblers to show the range of syntactical differences.</p>

<h3>Xcode assembly language project</h3>

<p>Although Xcode doesn&#8217;t have an assembly language project template, you can start a new command line tool project for Mac OS and just delete the main.m file.  Then you can add an assembly language file to the project and paste the following code:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4139421.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>.private_extern    _main
.globl  _main
_main:                                  #   main entry point

    pushq   %rbp

    movq    %rsp, %rbp

    leaq    _helloMessage(%rip), %rdi
    callq   _puts
    xorl    %eax, %eax
    popq    %rbp
    ret

.section    __TEXT,__cstring,cstring_literals

_helloMessage:  
    .asciz   &quot;Hello world!&quot;</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Like we&#8217;ve done with each of the prior tutorials, lets walk through the code, as simple as it is, step-by-step</p>

<h4>Step 1 - Preamble</h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">private_extern</span>   <span class="n">_main</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">globl</span>  <span class="n">_main</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nl">_main:</span>                                  <span class="err">#</span>   <span class="n">main</span> <span class="n">entry</span> <span class="n">point</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we&#8217;re just defining symbols for our entry point <code>_main</code>.</p>

<h4>Step 2 - Save frame pointer</h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="n">pushq</span>    <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rbp</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">movq</span>   <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rsp</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rbp</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we just save the frame pointer.</p>

<h4>Step 3 - Print a &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; string</h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="n">leaq</span> <span class="n">_helloMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rip</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rdi</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">callq</span>  <span class="n">_puts</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">//</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">section</span>    <span class="n">__TEXT</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">__cstring</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">cstring_literals</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nl">_helloMessage:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">asciz</span>   <span class="s">&quot;Hello world!&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we load a reference to the <code>_helloMessage</code> into <code>%rdi</code> our first function argument register.  And call <code>_puts</code>.  The <code>leaq</code> instruction is the 64-bit version of <code>lea</code> in x86 assembly.  This instruction places the <em>address</em> specified by the second operand into the register specified by the first operand.  It&#8217;s not the contents of the memory location that are loaded, only the effective address that is computed and placed into the register.  (Sounds like a pointer in higher level languages, doesn&#8217;t it?)</p>

<h4>Step 4 - Clean up</h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="n">xorl</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">eax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">eax</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">popq</span>   <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rbp</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ret</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we zero our function return register, pop the frame pointer, and return.  That was easy!</p>

<h3>NASM project</h3>

<p>Next, we&#8217;re going to go through an alternative way of getting the job done with an assembler called nasm - for &#8220;netwide assembler&#8221;.  It uses a very different syntax than we are accustomed to seeing from the analyses we&#8217;ve done so far.  We also are responsible for building the Mach-O object code and linking the program ourselves.  But it&#8217;s a good experience to go through.</p>

<h4>Download the 64-bit version of <code>nasm</code></h4>

<p>For compatibility with our GNU assembler version of the &#8220;Hello world&#8221; program, we want to do it in 64 bit form.  But the version of <code>nasm</code> that ships with Mac as of this writing is an older 32 bit version.  You can check it our on your computer with <code>nasm -v</code> at the Terminal.  On my machine, it is <code>0.98.40</code>.  We need to download the latest version before continuing.  You can find it <a href="http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.10.05/macosx/">here</a>.  I just downloaded it, unzipped, and copied to <code>/usr/bin</code> so I wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with mofiying the path.</p>

<h4>Write the program for use in <code>nasm</code></h4>

<p>Here&#8217;s the complete source:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4139297.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>;
;
;   hello64.asm
;
;   A quick demonstration of 64 assembly language on Mac OS
;

;nasm-2.09.10 -f macho64 hello64.asm
;

;gcc -m64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk -o hello64 hello64.o
;

section .data
    
    hello            db &quot;Hello, world!&quot;, 0  

section .text
    
    global _main
    extern _puts

_main:
    push    r15             ;save %r15 to stack
    mov     r15,    rsp     ;load the stack pointer into %r15
    push    rbx             ;push base pointer to the stack

    mov     rbx,    rsp     ;load the stack pointer into the base pointer
    and     spl,    0xF0    ;align the stack pointer on a boundary

    mov     rdi,    hello   ;move address of string to %rdi (1st function arg register)
    call    _puts           ;call puts

    mov     rsp,    rbx     ;mov %rbx back into stack pointer after the library call

    pop     rbx             ;restore %rbx (a callee saved register)
    mov     rsp,    r15     ;restore the stack pointer from %r15
    pop     r15             ;restore %r15
    ret</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>The first thing to recognize with <code>nasm</code> syntax is that the operand order is reversed compared with the GNU assembler syntax.  So the instruction <code>mov r15, rsp</code> moves the contents of register <code>rsp</code> to <code>r15</code>.  We also omit the <code>%</code> sign before register names.  And nasm infers the correct version of an instruction depending on the width of the operands; so we use <code>mov</code> instead of <code>movb</code>, <code>movl</code>, or <code>movq</code>.  Apart from those differences, we do things the same way.  Let&#8217;s go through the program step-by-step.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Application sections</h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="n">section</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">data</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">hello</span>            <span class="n">db</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">section</span> <span class="p">.</span><span class="n">text</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">global</span> <span class="n">_main</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">extern</span> <span class="n">_puts</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We being with a data section that contain a single symbol <code>hello</code>.  <code>db</code> signifies a data block.  In this case the data block is a NULL-terminated string.  The <code>0</code> after the string is the NULL termination.  After the <code>.data</code> section, we have the <code>.text</code> section which is the code.  He expose <code>_main</code> - our entry point - as a global symbol and mame note that <code>_puts</code> is defined elsewhere and will need to be linked.</p>

<h4>Step 2: Prologue</h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="nl">_main:</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">push</span>    <span class="n">r15</span>             <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">save</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">r15</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">stack</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">mov</span>     <span class="n">r15</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="n">rsp</span>     <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">load</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="n">pointer</span> <span class="n">into</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">r15</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">push</span>    <span class="n">rbx</span>             <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">push</span> <span class="n">base</span> <span class="n">pointer</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stack</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>This is similar to the prologues we&#8217;ve seen before - but take a close look here at the reversed order of the operands.  If you don&#8217;t understand what our function prologue is doing at this point, best go back to our earlier tutorials and review.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Call <code>puts</code></h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="n">mov</span>     <span class="n">rbx</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="n">rsp</span>     <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">load</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="n">pointer</span> <span class="n">into</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">base</span> <span class="n">pointer</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">and</span>     <span class="n">spl</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="mh">0xF0</span>    <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">align</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="n">pointer</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">boundary</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">mov</span>     <span class="n">rdi</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="n">hello</span>   <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">move</span> <span class="n">address</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">string</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rdi</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="n">st</span> <span class="n">function</span> <span class="n">arg</span> <span class="k">register</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">call</span>    <span class="n">_puts</span>           <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">call</span> <span class="n">puts</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first two instructions have the effect of aligning the stack pointer to a 16 byte boundary as required by the x86_64 ABI before the upcoming call.  Then we move the address of the symbol <code>hello</code> to the <code>%rdi</code> register (the first function argument register) and call <code>_puts</code>.</p>

<h4>Step 4: Cleanup</h4>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='c-objdump'><span class='line'><span class="n">mov</span>     <span class="n">rsp</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="n">rbx</span>     <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">mov</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rbx</span> <span class="n">back</span> <span class="n">into</span> <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="n">pointer</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">library</span> <span class="n">call</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">pop</span>     <span class="n">rbx</span>             <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">restore</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">rbx</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">callee</span> <span class="n">saved</span> <span class="k">register</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">mov</span>     <span class="n">rsp</span><span class="p">,</span>    <span class="n">r15</span>     <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">restore</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="n">pointer</span> <span class="n">from</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">r15</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">pop</span>     <span class="n">r15</span>             <span class="p">;</span><span class="n">restore</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="n">r15</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ret</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All that&#8217;s left is to clean up, restoring the registers and the stack before returning.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://i.imgur.com/a7rqS.png" title="&#34;Build, link, run&#34;" alt="&#34;Build, link, run&#34;"></p>

<h4>Build</h4>

<p>But the program text file isn&#8217;t useful by itself.  Save it to disk as &#8220;hello64.asm&#8221;.  Now we need to generate the object code.  You will need to adjust the path names but on my machine, it&#8217;s: <code>nasm-2.09.10 -f macho64 hello64.asm</code> to generate the 64-bit Mach-O object code and <code>gcc -m64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk -o hello64 hello64.o</code> to link it.</p>

<p>Now to run our little application, from the directory where it resides:  <code>/.hello64</code>.</p>
