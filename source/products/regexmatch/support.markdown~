### RegexMatch support ###

#### FGA's (Frequently Given Answers) ####

> What programming languages are currently supported?

You can export code in Objective-C, Perl, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby.  It seemed like these were the right ones to start with; but if you really want others, drop us a line.

> How do I export code?

We imagine you want to actually use your code somewhere.  So RegexMatch can export code to the pasteboard - so that you can paste it into another app such as a text editor, or you can email the code to yourself (or someone else, for that matter.)

> Does it use standard regex syntax.

Yes, of course.

> Do you have a trial, or lite version?

No, sorry.

> How can I save regular expressions that I want to use or work on later?

You can use Snapshots for that purpose.  In the main table, just add (+) to add a new Snapshot.  Give it a name; and RegexMatch will persist it for it.

> There's something I don't like about the App.  What can I do?

We'd definitely like to hear from you so we can fix whatever you're noticing.  Of course, you can always review it on the App Store - but if you've got something tough to say, give us a chance first.  If you're using the app, chances are you're also a developer, let's keep it nice and collegial.

> How can I get in touch with you if there's a problem?

Two ways: alan@cocoa-factory.com and @NSBum
