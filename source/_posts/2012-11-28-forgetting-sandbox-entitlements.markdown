I was recently prepping a Mac OS app for Sandbox compliance but couldn't figure out why the following error: `NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=1 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. Operation not permitted"`

Finally it dawned on me that even simple outgoing network requests from the app, need to be specifically enabled thusly.

I wish the error were more descriptive or that the `userInfo` dictionary of the `NSError` at least had a Sandbox violation description key.
